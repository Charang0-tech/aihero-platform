        content: `
Control flow allows your programs to make decisions and respond differently based on conditions. This is fundamental in AI for processing data, handling different scenarios, and implementing logic.

## Basic if Statement
The if statement executes code only when a condition is True.

## if/else Statement  
Use else to handle the case when the condition is False.

## if/elif/else Chain
Use elif (else if) to check multiple conditions in sequence.

## Comparison Operators
- **==** : Equal to
- **!=** : Not equal to  
- **<** : Less than
- **>** : Greater than
- **<=** : Less than or equal to
- **>=** : Greater than or equal to

Creates sequences of numbers for loops.

- **break**: Exit the loop immediately
